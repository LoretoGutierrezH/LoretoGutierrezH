### Aloha!

My name is Loreto Guti√©rrez and I'm a front-end developer from Chile, with a keen interest in back-end development as well.

My stack: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React
I'm currently learning: Redux, Node, Express, MongoDB + trying to get a good math base to approach more complex computer science subjects
I'm currently working on: my professional portfolio and in some personal projects I expect to finish in the next few months.

To know more about me, I invite you to visit my portafolio at ****** or give a look at some of my repositories to get to know the inner workings of my apps.

You can also contact me directly at loretocgh@gmail.com
